                    <h3>InnovationForce</h3>
                    <p>InnovationForce is a cloud based SaaS startup that helps large organizations, especially utilities, accelerate and streamline innovation. Its platform, InnovationWorks, combines AI, crowd wisdom and Harvard backed frameworks to move ideas from conception to pilot faster and avoid “pilot purgatory.” By measuring cultural factors like psychological safety and automating evaluation and decision workflows, it reduces friction and speeds up collaboration.</p> 
                    <p>During my time as a software intern at InnovationForce I built and deployed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents that improved user self-service adoption. I also designed web crawlers using Crawl4AI, enabling clients to independently conduct market research, which reduced reliance on outsourced analysts and saved companies significant hiring costs. In addition, I automated research workflows and streamlined database queries, saving employees over 100 hours and increasing overall efficiency. Finally, I contributed to UI development that enhanced internal tool usability and reduced onboarding time for new employees.</p>

As the lead of the electrical subteam, I have helped design and implement the ride height sensor module to analyze vehicle performance and dynamics.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am leading efforts to transform the electrical team into a data-driven group, organizing the development of new modules such as hall effect sensors, GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, and more. This shift enables us to collect and utilize real-time data for vehicle diagnostics and performance optimization, advancing our capabilities beyond previous years.</p></div>
